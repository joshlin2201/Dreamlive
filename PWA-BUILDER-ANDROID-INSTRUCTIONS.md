# 🎯 Getting Your Android APK from PWA Builder

## Important: Make Sure You Select ANDROID, Not Windows!

I just opened PWA Builder in your browser. Here's exactly what to do:

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. Wait for Analysis
PWA Builder will analyze your app at https://dreamlive.vercel.app/

### 2. Click "Package For Stores"
At the top of the page, you'll see navigation tabs. Click **"Package For Stores"**

### 3. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Select the "ANDROID" Tab
You'll see multiple platform tabs:
- **Windows** (this is what you just downloaded - wrong one!)
- **Android** ← **CLICK THIS ONE!**
- iOS
- Meta Quest

**Make sure you click the ANDROID tab!**

### 4. Fill in Android Details
Once on the Android tab, fill in:
- **Package ID**: `com.dreamlandmaidcafe.livepro`
- **App name**: `Dreamland Live Pro`
- **App version**: `1.0.0`
- **Host**: `https://dreamlive.vercel.app`
- **Start URL**: `/`

### 5. Click "Generate"
Click the button to generate your Android package

### 6. Download the APK
This time you'll get a different zip file with:
- ✅ `app-release-signed.apk` ← This is what you need!

## 📲 After You Download:

1. **Extract the zip file**
2. **Find the .apk file** (it will be named something like `app-release-signed.apk`)
3. **Transfer to Android tablet**:
   - USB cable
   - Email it to yourself
   - Upload to Google Drive
   - AirDrop (if supported)
4. **On tablet: Tap the APK file**
5. **Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"** if prompted
6. **Tap "Install"**
7. **Open Dreamland Live Pro!**

## 🎵 What You'll Get:

✅ Perfect 3-second fade in/out functionality
✅ No iOS restrictions
✅ Beautiful Dreamland pink theme
✅ Landscape tablet mode

**Remember: Select the ANDROID tab, not Windows!**

The APK file is the only thing that will work on Android tablets.
