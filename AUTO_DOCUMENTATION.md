# Auto-Documentation Protocol

## Overview
This document defines the protocols for maintaining project documentation and ensuring all changes are tracked and documented.

## Protocols
1. **GEMINI.md**: Maintain this file as the primary source of truth for the project context, tech stack, and testing commands.
2. **task.md**: Track all high-level tasks and their progress. Update this file as work proceeds.
3. **implementation_plan.md**: Create a technical plan for all major changes and get user approval before proceeding to execution.
4. **walkthrough.md**: After completing a task, create a walkthrough documenting the changes, tests performed, and validation results.

## Documentation Location
All artifacts should be stored in the designated brain directory for this conversation:
`<appDataDir>/brain/<conversation-id>/`
